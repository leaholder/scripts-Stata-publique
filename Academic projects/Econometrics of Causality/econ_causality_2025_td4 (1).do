/*
A large literature investigates the relationship between government policies and voters' choices. Many studies for instance have found that economic conditions around election time have predictive power for the incumbent's re-election success. However, there is less evidence on the effect of household economic conditions, and especially in targeted government transfers, on the evolution of voter preferences. Manacordan, Miguel, and Vigorito (2011) investigate whether being a recipient of a cash transfer program has an impact on political support for the government that implemented it. In March 2005, the Uruguayan government launched a large anti-poverty program, PANES. Household eligibility for the program was determined by a predicted income score based on various pre-program covariates. Thus, only households with scores below a predetermined threshold were eligible for PANES. The data for this exercise, which is the same as those used by Manacordan, Miguel, and Vigorito (2011), are located in the Donnees.dta file. They contain socioeconomic characteristics and political preferences for a sample of 1,942 Households. Eligibility to the program is measured by the variable called newtreat.

The problem is that the treated individuals are poor and the individuals in the control group are rich, which would introduce selection bias. One would have to control for the distance to the threshold as well.

Following Manacordan, Miguel, and Vigorito (2011), the measure of political support that we will use is the support to the current left-wing government Frente Amplio during the program. The variable for this is called support07. Compare the mean of this variable across eligible and non-eligible households. Is the difference statistically significant? Is it large when compared to the mean value? What does it suggest about the power of social policies on support to the government?

/*
To determine program allocation, the government used a predicted income score that depended only on household socioeconomic characteristics collected in the baseline survey. Only households with predicted income scores below a predetermined threshold were assigned to program treatment. An important element to be considered in such a program is to know whether the eligible population received the program. Estimate the share of the eligible household which received PANES. Next, use a graphic to show whether the eligible households were enrolled in the program. What can you conclude about the implementation of the program? How can you define the threshold used?

/*
The authors use a regression discontinuity design to make sure they are comparing similar households. To do this, they consider that program assignment around the eligibility threshold was nearly "as good as random". As a check for non-random assignment, the authors estimated whether pre-treatment covariates vary discontinuously at the eligibility threshold. Based on your previous answers, what can you conclude regarding the validity of their identification assumption? What does it imply on the 1 household assignment to PANES?

Let us now measure the impact of receiving PANES on government support. The estimated equation is : 

support = alpha + beta*newstreat + f1[N_1] + newstreat*f_2[N_i] + epsilon 

s=β_0+β_1 〖newtreat〗_i+f_1 N_i+〖newtreat〗_i×f_2 N_i+ε_i

where newtreat is a dummy equal to 1 if the normalized income score of household i is negative, i.e. it receives PANES. N_i is the normalized income score of household i ; f1 and f2 are parametric polynomials in the normalized income score on either side of the eligible threshold. Estimate the regression without and with the following controls : pre-program characteristics of household members, log per-capita income, age, education, and gender of the household head, as well as localidad fixed-effects. Compare this to a simple comparison of mean in government support. Were there big changes in the estimated difference ? What happens if you add and interacted the eligibility status with a polynomial in the standardized score of degrees 1, and 2 ? Does this suggest that the program has a robust effect on government support ?

Without any control = mean comparison: Households receiving PANES are significantly more supportive of the government. Eligibility for the program implies an 11 percentage point increase in support for the government compared to the opposition (89% compared to 78%).

Lastly, two important questions arise: did the program have persistent impacts on government support? To do this, we measure the political support in 2008, 1 year after the program. You should use the variable called support08. Did the program induce higher support on other political institutions and organizations than the current government?
